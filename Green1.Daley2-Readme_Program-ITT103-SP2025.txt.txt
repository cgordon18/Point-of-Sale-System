Program Documentation: Point of Sale (POS) System

This program is a simple Point of Sale (POS) system for a supermarket, designed to allow cashiers to manage transactions efficiently. The system enables cashiers to:
- View available products with their prices and stock quantities.
- Add items to a shopping cart while validating stock availability.
- Remove items from the cart and restock them in the inventory.
- View the cart's contents along with total prices.
- Process checkout by calculating the subtotal, applying discounts and sales tax, and handling payments.
- Generate a formatted receipt for the customer.

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the provided script as `pos_system.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the program by executing the command:
   ```
   python pos_system.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the POS system.


To customize or extend the functionality of this POS system, consider the following modifications:
- **Product Catalog Updates:** Modify the `products` dictionary to include new products, adjust prices, or update stock levels.
- **Discount Rules:** Change the discount criteria or percentage in the `checkout()` function.
- **Tax Rate:** Modify the sales tax percentage in the `checkout()` function.
- **Receipt Formatting:** Adjust the `generate_receipt()` function to change the appearance of the receipt.
- **Database Integration:** Replace the in-memory product catalog with a database for persistent storage.
- **GUI Interface:** Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.


- The program assumes that product names entered by the user match those in the catalog (case-insensitive handling is applied).
- The cashier must enter valid numeric values for quantities and payments.
- The inventory stock is updated only for the current session; restarting the program resets stock levels.
- The system does not support barcode scanning or advanced inventory management features.
- Payments must be entered manually; no direct integration with payment gateways is included.
- The program is designed for single-user operation and does not include multi-user authentication or role-based access control.
